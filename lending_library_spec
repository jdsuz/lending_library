A web app called Lending Library that allows users to log the products (books, tools, etc.) theyâ€™re interested in lending and to make exchanges. The Lending Library home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new products, add new entries/exchanges, and read and edit existing products (that belong to them).

product characteristics
	Title
	Description
	Date Added
	Owner
	Location
	Cost (if any)


Backlog:
	- Create a "borrower" attribute
		- borrower user type
		- is_available attribute
	- Books Borrowed/Books Loaned
		- books loaned should just be designated in the MyLibrary
	- Uniform style for all pages
	- get on GitHub
	- STATIC FILES
	- fix borrow button
	- turn entries into comments/history 
	- add Header/Footer to base.html
	- add location (like craigslist)
	- add location based timestamps/timezones
	- handle images


available = models.BooleanField(default=True) --> put in product model

What are you trying to do?
	- Introduce the concept of a "borrower" to a product/book. A borrower should be able to borrow a book andd eventually request to borrow a book.
What have you tried so far?
	- Different User Models
	- ForeignKey, OneToOneField, ManyToManyField
What results have you been getting?
	- I don't believe I need different user types because all users should be both a lender and a borrower. 
	- When trying to add a borrower attribute to the Products model I get: IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: new__products_product.borrower_id
